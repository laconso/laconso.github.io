				<p>a bit about me</p> 
				<img src="images/portrait.jpg">
				<p>I am currently in Admissions at General Assembly. In this role I get to speak with people from all different backgrounds and help them to achieve their professional goals. As someone who always loves to learn something new, I have taken a few classes at General Assembly that have allowed me to build my own professional skills in the UX/Product Design field and I am looking to transition into a UX Design role.</p>
